<h3>...about the visualization</h3>
The Data Explorer group has decided to endow a chair
in user interface research at the
IBM T. J. Watson Research Center.  How much does the
endowment cost?  The group had prepared an analysis based
on its estimate of its cost of capital.  Then Martin
noted that it would be nice to increase the new 
person's salary each year.  Here is the resulting
analysis.  It assumes that the chair holder will
be paid $50,000 in her first year.  You estimate
the interest rate and specify a growth factor by
<i>pick</i>ing on the spot on the curve you feel
most accurately represents the real world.

<h3>...about the web page</h3>
You can enter <i>pick</i> mode by selecting "Pick"
in the Mode selector.  Then place a pick on
the image by clicking with the left mouse button.
The "Execution" indicator
turns green when Data Explorer is executing.  
After you've picked, the visualization will show
the present value of the perpetual stream of cash flows
representing the salary for the endowed chair.  In other
words, it shows how much the Data Explorer group will
have to invest today in order to pay for the chair.
<h3>...about <i>Pick</i> mode</h3>
When you place a pick on an image rendered by Data Explorer,
you're identifying a location on (2d or 3d) object. Data 
Explorer automatically translates the screen's x,y pick
location
into an x,y or x,y,z location in the object's coordinate
space.  Then the position on the object is used to lookup
the data value from that point on the object.
